I moved to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) from [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) today, finally, for my personal blogging tool. I am always a happy [WP](http://www.wordpress.org) user (*playing with it since 2005/6?*). However, it seems more and more heavier to me as just a blogging tool.

I started to look for something else months ago (although I am not a frequent blogger) and came to bump up with [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). It caught me a lot immediately because working with [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) looks like a happy hacking :) I can do JS, CSS, HTML, Markdown and very little Ruby (and I am thinking of learning it for years).

The overall experience of playing [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). It is very easy to install on my Mac and deploy via RSync. I will play style and theme late on and of course plugins. 

It is interesting to [find out](https://www.google.com/search?q=octopress%20move) lots of people did the same, by moving/migrating to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) and starting with a post similar to this one. 

And it is a joy of hacking.
